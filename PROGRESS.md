# Progress Tracker: EchoMuse AR

This document logs the development progress of the EchoMuse AR High-Fidelity UI/UX Prototype, transitioning from initial wireframes to a functional React/Three.js application.

## Completed Milestones

### 1. Requirements & Planning
- [x] **Analyzed PRD:** Reviewed the initial Product Requirements Document and wireframes.
- [x] **Agent Alignment:** Synced development goals with `AGENTS.md` (Norman's & Nielsen's principles, Gestalt layout).
- [x] **Design Specifications (`DESIGN.md`):** Established visual identity focusing on Apple HIG Glassmorphism, the "Purple Spectrum", and clear accessibility guidelines.
- [x] **Technical Specifications (`HIFI.md`):** Defined the tech stack (React, Vite, Tailwind, Zustand, Three.js/R3F) and clarified the scope as a standalone, no-backend UI/UX prototype. Integrated `lucide-react` strategy to reduce 2D asset friction.
- [x] **Task Delegation (`USERTASK.md`):** Created a clear checklist for manual user tasks (sourcing 3D models, audio, and device testing).

### 2. Architecture & Data Foundation
- [x] **Directory Structure:** Scaffoled the initial project directories (`public/models/`, `src/components/ui/`, `src/mocks/`, etc.).
- [x] **Instrument Mock Data:** Researched and created `src/mocks/instruments.json` featuring accurate historical context and specific AR gesture mappings for:
  - **Kompang** (Tap)
  - **Serunai** (Blow/Hold)
  - **Sape** (Pluck/Swipe)
- [x] **Achievement Mock Data:** Created `src/mocks/achievements.json` with minimal, UI-ready data, utilizing dynamic `iconName` strings (e.g., "Trophy", "Drum", "Wind") to interface seamlessly with `lucide-react`.

### 3. Phase 1: Visual Foundation (Complete)
- [x] **Project Initialization:** Set up Vite, React, and TypeScript.
- [x] **Tailwind & Glassmorphism:** Configured Tailwind v4 with custom `glass-*` utilities and the "EchoMuse AR Purple" spectrum.
- [x] **Routing & Transitions:** Implemented `react-router-dom` and Framer Motion for smooth page transitions.
- [x] **UI Shell:** Built initial `Home.tsx` and `Login.tsx` components.

### 4. Phase 2: Interactive Gallery & Design Refactor (Complete)
- [x] **Zustand Integration:** Wired up global state for instruments, achievements, and user discovery progress.
- [x] **HUD Architecture:** Refactored the UI from traditional centered layouts to a premium Heads-Up Display (HUD) with corner-anchored controls.
- [x] **Aesthetic Overhaul:** 
    - Migrated typography to **Helvetica** on a 4px baseline grid.
    - Standardized **blur(12px)** glassmorphism across all components.
    - Updated all iconography to **1px thin stroke weights**.
- [x] **Pill-Shaped Navigation:** Implemented a floating, micro-shadowed bottom dock.
- [x] **Core Screens Built:** Completed `Gallery`, `InstrumentDetail`, `InstrumentHistory`, `Profile`, `Settings`, `Achievements`, and `Scanner`.
- [x] **Haptic Visuals:** Added ring-expansion feedback and geometric mesh overlays to the scanning experience.

### 5. Phase 3: AR Simulation & 3D (Complete)
- [x] **R3F Integration:** Successfully integrated `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei`.
- [x] **Model Loading:** Implemented `InstrumentModel.tsx` using `useGLTF` with auto-centering and studio lighting.
- [x] **360° Viewer:** Built `ARViewer.tsx` with `OrbitControls` and HUD overlays.
- [x] **In-Situ Previews:** Replaced placeholders in `InstrumentDetail.tsx` with live 3D canvas previews.

### 6. Phase 4: Audio & Interaction Polish (Complete)
- [x] **State Machine:** Implemented Play Mode vs 360 Explore Mode logic.
- [x] **Camera Snapping:** Added `CameraRig` to smoothly interpolate to Fixed Views (Top, Front, Right).
- [x] **Gesture Engine:** Overlaid a gesture detection area to trigger audio.
- [x] **Haptics:** Built a visual geometric ring-expansion at the point of interaction.

## Current Status
**In Progress: Final Polish & Deployment.**

### 7. Phase 5: Scanner & Real Camera Functionality (Complete)
- [x] **HTML5-QRCode Integration:** Replaced static scanning UI with a live webcam feed parser.
- [x] **Fallback States:** Added robust error handling and UI for denied permissions or unavailable hardware.
- [x] **Dev Bypass HUD:** Included a top-bar "Fast Forward" button for bypassing the camera requirement during desktop testing.
- [x] **Permission Fixes:** Explicitly call `Html5Qrcode.getCameras()` to force OS-level hardware permission prompts consistently.

### 8. Mobile Browser Optimization (Complete)
- [x] **Viewport Lockdown:** Added `viewport-fit=cover` and locked `html, body` positioning to fix native rubber-band scrolling and URL bar resizing issues on iOS/Android.
- [x] **Memory Management:** Migrated 3D model duplication from `scene.clone()` to `@react-three/drei`'s `<Clone />` component, sharing geometry arrays across the app to reduce RAM usage.
- [x] **GPU Restraints:** Clamped all `<Canvas>` contexts to `dpr={[1, 1.5]}` and reduced HDR Environment map resolution to `256` to ensure 60fps on high-DPI mobile screens without overheating.
- [x] **Battery Saver:** Switched the gallery's 3D preview to `frameloop="demand"` so the renderer sleeps while the static asset is viewed.
- [x] **Scanner Threading:** Dropped the QR analysis frequency to `fps: 5` to unblock the main JS thread on slower mobile CPUs.
- [x] **Audio State Management:** Forced audio elements to pause instantly upon exiting AR Play Mode or component unmounting.

### 9. Phase 6: Desktop Polish & UI Consistency (Complete)
- [x] **Desktop AR Gestures:** Added velocity-based mouse movement detection for strumming without clicking, `onWheel` tracking for two-finger trackpad swipes, and Spacebar listeners to handle "hold-to-blow" mechanics reliably on non-touch devices.
- [x] **Pointer Drag Resilience:** Upgraded `handlePointerDown` to use `setPointerCapture` to ensure rapid dragging doesn't break if the cursor accidentally leaves the interaction zone.
- [x] **Gallery Thumbnails:** Replaced static image placeholders in the Gallery list with dynamic, category-specific `lucide-react` icons (Circle, Wind, Music) for a cleaner UI.
- [x] **Profile Routing Continuity:** Matched the "Instruments" stats box interaction parity with the "Badges" box, adding hover states and a direct route to the Gallery.
